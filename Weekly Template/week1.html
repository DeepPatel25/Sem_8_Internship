    <h2>Section 3: Basics of C#</h2>
    <p>C# (pronounced C-sharp) is a versatile and modern programming language developed by Microsoft. Released in 2000,
      C# is designed for building robust and scalable applications on the Microsoft .NET framework. It combines the
      power of C++ with the simplicity of Java, making it a popular choice for a wide range of software development
      tasks.</p>

    <p>C# supports object-oriented programming principles, providing features such as encapsulation, inheritance, and
      polymorphism. It boasts a strong type system that enhances code reliability and readability. The language is
      statically typed, meaning variable types must be declared at compile-time, aiding in early error detection.</p>

    <p>C# excels in creating Windows desktop applications, web applications using ASP.NET, and game development through
      the Unity game engine. It also supports asynchronous programming with features like async/await, facilitating the
      development of responsive and efficient applications.</p>

    <p>With a rich standard library and continuous updates, C# remains a preferred language for developers, enabling
      them to create high-performance and secure applications across various domains, from enterprise software to mobile
      and cloud-based solutions.</p>

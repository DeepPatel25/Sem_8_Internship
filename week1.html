      <h2>Section 3: Basics of C#</h2>
      <p>
        C# (pronounced C-sharp) is a versatile and modern programming language
        developed by Microsoft. Released in 2000, C# is designed for building
        robust and scalable applications on the Microsoft .NET framework. It
        combines the power of C++ with the simplicity of Java, making it a
        popular choice for a wide range of software development tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        C# supports object-oriented programming principles, providing features
        such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It boasts a strong
        type system that enhances code reliability and readability. The language
        is statically typed, meaning variable types must be declared at
        compile-time, aiding in early error detection.
      </p>

      <p>
        C# excels in creating Windows desktop applications, web applications
        using ASP.NET, and game development through the Unity game engine. It
        also supports asynchronous programming with features like async/await,
        facilitating the development of responsive and efficient applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a rich standard library and continuous updates, C# remains a
        preferred language for developers, enabling them to create
        high-performance and secure applications across various domains, from
        enterprise software to mobile and cloud-based solutions.
      </p>

      <p>An example of C# code</p>
      <pre>

{
    // Entry point of the program
    static void Main()
    {
        // Variables and Data Types

        double height = 5.9;
        string name = "John";
        char gender = 'M';
        bool isStudent = true;

        // Output
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Gender: {gender}, Is Student: {isStudent}");

      <h2>Section 4 :- Introduction Web Development in C#</h2>
      <p>
        Web development in C# is commonly done using the ASP.NET framework,
        which is a powerful and versatile technology for building dynamic and
        interactive web applications. ASP.NET supports the development of both
        traditional web forms and modern, lightweight and modular web
        applications using ASP.NET Core. In this introduction, let's focus on
        ASP.NET Core.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Components of Web Development in C#: ASP.NET Core:</h4>
      <p>
        1. ASP.NET Core: ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform
        framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected
        applications. It's highly modular and allows developers to choose the
        components they need, making it more lightweight and flexible.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture: ASP.NET Core follows the
        MVC architectural pattern, which separates the application into three
        main components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface),
        and Controller (handles user input and manages communication between
        Model and View).
      </p>
      <p>
        3. C# Programming Language: C# is a strongly-typed, object-oriented
        programming language developed by Microsoft. It's the primary language
        used for ASP.NET Core development. C# provides a rich set of features,
        including LINQ (Language Integrated Query) for data manipulation and
        modern language constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Entity Framework: Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping
        (ORM) framework that simplifies database interactions in C#
        applications. It allows developers to work with databases using C#
        objects, making database operations more natural and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Razor Pages and Views: Razor is a view engine that enables the
        creation of dynamic and expressive views in ASP.NET Core. Razor Pages
        provide a simpler page-based programming model, while Razor Views are
        used within the MVC framework for rendering HTML.
      </p>

      <h2>Section 5 :- Creating web API</h2>
      <p>
        Creating a Web API project in C# involves building a service that
        exposes endpoints to handle HTTP requests and responses, typically for
        data exchange using JSON or XML. In this example, I'll guide you through
        creating a simple Web API project using ASP.NET Core.
      </p>

      <h4>Step-by-Step Guide:</h4>
      <p>
        1. Install Visual Studio: If you haven't already, download and install
        Visual Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Create a New ASP.NET Core Web API Project: Open Visual Studio and
        create a new project. Select "ASP.NET Core Web Application" as the
        project template. Choose the "API" template and select the target
        framework (e.g., .NET 5.0).
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Create a Controller: In the newly created project, open the
        "Controllers" folder. Create a new controller (e.g.,
        ValuesController.cs).
      </p>
      <pre>
<code>
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{
    // GET: api/values
    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;string>> Get()
    {
        return new string[] { "value1", "value2" };
    }

    // GET: api/values/5
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public ActionResult&lt;string> Get(int id)
    {
        return "value";
    }

    // POST: api/values
    [HttpPost]
    public void Post([FromBody] string value)
    {
    }

    // PUT: api/values/5
    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public void Put(int id, [FromBody] string value)
    {
    }

    // DELETE: api/values/5
    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public void Delete(int id)
    {
    }
}
</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        4. Run the Project: Press F5 to run the project. This will launch the
        development server.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. Test the API Endpoints: Open a browser or use a tool like Postman to
        test your API. Visit https://localhost:5001/api/values to see the
        response from the Get method.
      </p>

      <p>
        6. Expand the API: Add more methods to the controller or create
        additional controllers to handle different resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Section 6 :- Http Caching</h2>

      <p>
        HTTP caching is a technique used to store copies of web resources (such
        as HTML pages, images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files) on the client
        side or at intermediate points (such as proxy servers) to reduce
        latency, minimize server load, and improve the overall performance of
        web applications. Caching is crucial for optimizing the speed and
        efficiency of web browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data or information in
        a local memory, for a certain time period. So, next time, when the
        client requests the same information, instead of retrieving the
        information from the database, it will give the information from the
        local memory. The main advantage of caching is that it improves the
        performance by reducing the processing burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTTP caching involves the use of cache control headers in HTTP
        responses, which instruct the client's browser or intermediate proxy
        servers on how to handle the caching of a particular resource.
      </p>

      <h2>Section 7 :- Security in Web Development</h2>

      <p>
        1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): CORS is a security feature
        implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests
        to a different domain than the one that served the web page. To enable
        cross-origin requests, server-side configurations need to include
        appropriate headers, such as Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the
        identity of a user. Common authentication mechanisms include
        username/password, social media logins, or multi-factor authentication.
        In C#, authentication can be implemented using ASP.NET Identity for
        ASP.NET applications or IdentityServer for more advanced scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Authorization: Authorization determines what actions a user is
        allowed to perform. Role-based or claims-based authorization is often
        used to grant or deny access to specific resources. ASP.NET provides a
        role-based authorization system, and policies can be defined to control
        access at a more granular level.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Exception Handling: Proper exception handling is essential for
        security and debugging. It helps prevent sensitive information from
        being exposed to users and provides a way to log and handle errors
        gracefully. In C#, exceptions can be caught and handled using try-catch
        blocks, and custom exception classes can be created for specific
        scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of
        representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's commonly
        used for authentication and information exchange between parties. In C#,
        libraries like System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt or third-party libraries
        can be used to generate and validate JWTs.
      </p>

      <h2>Section 8 :- API Testing Tools</h2>
      <p>
        1. Swagger: Swagger, now known as the OpenAPI Specification, is a
        framework that allows developers to design, document, and consume
        RESTful APIs. It provides a standardized way to describe and define the
        structure of an API using a JSON or YAML format. Swagger not only aids
        in API documentation but also serves as a foundation for code generation
        in multiple programming languages. Developers can use Swagger to create
        a clear and concise representation of their API endpoints,
        request/response models, and other relevant information. This
        standardized documentation helps both developers and consumers
        understand how to interact with the API, leading to improved
        collaboration and streamlined development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Postman: Postman is an API development and testing tool that
        simplifies the process of building, testing, and documenting APIs. It
        offers a user-friendly interface for creating and managing API requests,
        making it easy for developers to send requests, inspect responses, and
        debug API endpoints. Postman supports various authentication methods,
        enables the creation of automated test scripts, and provides
        collaboration features for team members working on API projects. Beyond
        testing, Postman also facilitates the creation of API documentation,
        making it a comprehensive tool for API development and maintenance.
